# Full legalization

There are agencies that do this for you. Keep in mind that documents taken out in Indonesia can only be fully legalized **in** Indonesia, while the documents taken out in Serbia can only be legalized in Serbia.

For legalising the Indonesian documents, we used an [agency][1], so I don't know the process of legalising it manually.
You can try googling it, [this site][3] seems like a good place, it instructs you to use an [android app][2]


To [legalize the Serbian documents][6](mainly the certificate of marriage(you get it after you get married in Serbia)), you can also use an agency, [this one][4] charges 4000RSD. That article also describes the process of legalisation, so I only need to summarize:

1. You need to translate the document to English(at the time of writing, there is no Serbian-Indonesian) translator.
    - The translator needs to be registered to the opstina where the marriage certificate was issued
    - The documents need to be stamped by the translator and tied together with either the original, or the photocopy of the original.
        
        Tell the translator that you need the translation for the full legalisation, and hopefully they'll know what to do.
        You should call the [Indonesian embassy][5] to ask what and where to go to in order to fully legalize the document

2. After that according to the [ministarstvo pravde][6] and [this translation agency][4] you need to go to your local **prvi osnovni sud**

    The one in Novi Beograd works from 09:00 - 13:00 and you need to make an appointment by calling the number 0116553724
    They are at the address Bulevar Nikole Tesle 42a, Belgrade, close to Hotel Jugoslavija.
    There's a post office in the building, so you needn't exit the building to pay the fee of around 2500RSD for the stamp
    But this is if you got married in one of the opstina that belongs to Belgrade. If you got married elsewhere, you need to figure out where to go on your own, sorry...
    
3. Then after the prvi osnovni sud has stamped your documents, you need to go to the ministarstvo pravde
    
    It is located at the address Nemanjina 22, Belgrade, there's also a post office in the building.
    These fellas will keep your documents for 3 work days, so try to go to them on Monday, so that you don't have to wait out the weekend in vain. And turn 3 days of waiting to 5 days(like I did *facepalm* ).
    The fee for this service is 1500RSD(you only have one document(marriage certificate), it gets more expensive if you have more documents)
    
4. After the (hopefully) 3 days of waiting, go and pick up the documents, and bring them to ministarstvo spoljnih poslova.
    
    The building is located two road crossings downhill on the address of Kneza Milosa 24-26, Belgrade.
    The fee should also be 1500RSD. The stamp should be done in 30 min.

5. With those three stamps, head to the embassy of Indonesia for the final stamp. When at the embassy, you can also ask them how to report a marriage to Indonesia....
