Documents to bring to the Indonesian embassy:

- A photo of yourself
- Indonesian ID card(do a photocopy if you can)
- Passport(do a photocopy if you can)
- Domicile letter from the police station(stamped "Obrazac1", aka "beli karton", see [prijava boravka stranca](./prijava_stranca.md))

But definitely call the Indonesian embassy to make sure that you bring all of the documents that you need.
