# Permanent stay in Serbia for Indonesians based on love

I'll try to explain the process needed to start living in Serbia with your loved one.

## But first, a disclaimer:

I'm just a regular guy, so, please don't hold me responsible if information you found here is incorrect/out of date. You should double check it anyway

## Disclaimer two

If you see that some info here is invalid/outdated, open an issue or do a PR.

Links do change and die. In the event that a link you clicked on isn't working:

1. Blame the company for not using [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
2. Open an issue stating what link, what document and what line number.
    - Optionally you may open a [PR](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github) too

## Laws do change

Most people see the law as a static thing that shall never change(at least I did).
When first asking around about the documentation required I had a few contradictory answers.

Some people were saying that *Visa D* is required for the temporary stay, and some were saying that no visa was needed.
That's because up until (don't quote me on this) 2018, *Visa D* was actually not required, and after that time, it has become mandatory.

Also some people kept saying that they didn't need the *Visa D* even after 2018. Turns out they had *Schengen Visa* **multiple entry** or *US Visa* **multiple entry**. I also read that countries that are visa free for Serbia for at least 90 days in the period of 180 days are also eligible to get the temporary stay. (Un)fortunately Indonesians are Visa free to enter Serbia for maximum of 30 days in the period of one year. But, it is safest to get the *Visa C* regardless, as the process of getting the temporary stay can take a while. On that note, there was a couple who got the temporary stay in the 30 days time, but I wouldn't count to be that lucky...

## What you'll need

- You should have 2000$ ready for documentation and for a visit to Turkey(plus however much you need for a ticket from Indonesia to Serbia(around 1000$))
- [**Fully legalized**][6] birth certificate
- [**Fully legalized**][6] single certificate
- *Notary stamped* certificate that according to Indonesia, there's no obstacles for concluding the marriage(Recommendation letter to get married abroad)
- *Visa C*
- voluntary health insurance
- *Notary stamped* invitation letter

## When reaching Serbia

1. Within 24h you have to go to the local police station of the area you're going to live in, to [register to your new address][3](be sure to take the paper that the police person there stamped(it is needed for marriage, and for the embassy))
2. You should call the embassy of Indonesia and ask them when to go there to [register][4] that you have arrived in Serbia(the limit to do this is again 24h upon arrival, but in my opinion, the police station registration is more important)
3. [Get married][5]

    At this point you can apply for *visa D* and at the same time, you can begin legalizing the Serbian marriage certificate(izvod iz maticne knjige vencanih), in order to register your marriage in Indonesia

4. Apply for *Visa D*
5. Legalize the Serbian marriage certificate
6. Once the *Visa D* is done, go to Turkey(or any other country, but Turkey is cool because it only requires an *E-Visa* for Indonesians) to pick up the *Visa D*
7. Apply for the temporary stay
8. Once the temporary stay has been granted, you are eligible for [health insurance][1]
8. Keep extending the temporary stay for 3 years
9. Apply for permanent stay
10. Apply for Serbian citizenship
