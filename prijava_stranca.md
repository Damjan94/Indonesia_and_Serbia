# Registering of a foreigner to an address

Read the [official page][1] of the Republic of Serbia on what is needed to register your loved one to an address.

In case your police station has many counters, it is the counter that is always on duty, where the police officer works on.

Call your local police station to confirm the required documents. To summarise the official page:

- From the official page of the RS, you need to download and fill in the "Obrazac 1", aka "Beli karton"
- You need the foreigner's passport
- You need your Serbian ID Card
    - If you own the place that you want to register the foreigner at, but you yourself are registered at a different place, it gets complicated, and you need to call the police station for more info.
    
### Alternatively, apparently you can use [e-uprava](https://euprava.gov.rs/) to register the foreigner, but I think that the police station approach is easier
